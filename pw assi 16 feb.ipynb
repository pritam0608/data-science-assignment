    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that enables efficient retrieval, updating, and management of that data. \n",
    "2. It is a crucial component in the field of information technology, serving as a repository for various types of data such as text, numbers, images, and more. \n",
    "3. Databases are commonly used in applications, websites, and systems to store and retrieve data quickly and reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It categorized into two types: SQL (Structured Query Language) databases and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases.\n",

    "* SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Model: Relational (organized in tables with predefined relationships).\n",
    "2. Schema: Predefined and structured.\n",
    "3. Scalability: Typically scales vertically (increasing power of a single server).\n",
    "4. Consistency and ACID Properties: Follows ACID properties for data integrity.\n",
    "5. Use Cases: Well-suited for applications with stable, well-defined data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Model: Various models (document-oriented, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, graph databases).\n",
    "2. Schema: Schema-less, providing flexibility to add new fields.\n",
    "3. Scalability: Designed to scale horizontally (distribution across multiple servers).\n",
    "4. Consistency and ACID Properties: May sacrifice some ACID properties for better performance, with a focus on eventual consistency.\n",
    "5. Use Cases: Ideal for dynamic, evolving data structures, high scalability, and performance-critical applications. Examples include MongoDB, Redis, and Cassandra."
